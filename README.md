### Academic Interest Classifier

#### Overview
This project aims to classify student interests in discussion room applications using machine learning models. The dataset consists of text responses from surveys conducted across various departments at Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta during the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated new learning models at universities, impacting student mental health due to reduced face-to-face interaction during distance learning. This study categorizes student interests using machine learning, employing Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM models. Steps include data collection, preprocessing, classification, evaluation, testing, and deployment. Random Forest outperformed other models, achieving 71.24% relevance in recommending academic interest tags. This research provides insights into mitigating pandemic impacts and enhancing educational experiences through technology.

#### Technologies Used
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK
